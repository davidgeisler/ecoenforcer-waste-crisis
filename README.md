# EcoEnforcer: Waste Crisis

Welcome to **EcoEnforcer: Waste Crisis**, a single-player, open-world game where trash isn’t just garbage—it’s your mission! You play as a rookie employee for **EcoSort Industries**, tasked with exploring a dystopian city overrun with waste. Your goal? Collect, sort, and save the world, one piece of trash at a time.

But there’s a twist—make too many mistakes, and the **Eco-Wraith** will come after you. It’s creepy, it’s thrilling, and it’s all about teaching proper waste segregation in a fun, slightly terrifying way.

## Features

- **Open-World Exploration:** Roam through gritty, trash-filled zones, from abandoned neighborhoods to chaotic industrial sites.
- **First-Person Gameplay:** See the world through your character’s eyes as you pick up and sort trash.
- **Educational Meets Thrill:** Learn about waste segregation while staying one step ahead of the Eco-Wraith.
- **Story-Driven Adventure:** Uncover the mystery of the Eco-Wraith and the history of this trash-ridden city.

## Why We Made This

This game is more than just entertainment—it’s a call to action for better waste management practices. We wanted to make learning about trash sorting exciting, immersive, and a little spooky.
